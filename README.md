> This is still in development, stay tuned!

Have you ever sat down to try and study, but end up on Twitter instead? Do you think you'll just watch this one video and then get to work, but inevitably waste three hours online? Do you just find yourself getting angry whenever you visit a certain subreddit, and don't need that kind of negativity in your life?

Hazard-Lights is a simple browser extension which subtly prompts you before entering any sites you've blacklisted. It's intended to help out your will-power by adding a little bit of friction to your web-surfing.

By installing this neat tool, you can:

- keep a website blacklist locally in your browser
- require a prompt whenever entering a blacklisted site
- set custom text for the prompt, and criteria
- pause the prompt for a set amount of time
- stay focused or avoid negativity
